### **General info**
Hi üëã! This is the second version of my website's mailer API (previous one was made with, which serves mainly as the backend for my portfolio's contact page (https://victorgomez.dev/contact). 

Also, it is my first Rusty program! Learned a bunch btw about it during this project, mainly about module organization among other things (which I will defenitely improve in other Rusty projects).

Hope you like it üòÑ!

### **Setup**
  > Note: You must have the Rust ngihtly toolchain installed on your environment (version "nightly-2022-07-20" preferably)
  > Recomended: to have ``cargo-make`` and ``fleet.rs`` installed

  *After downloading/cloning the repository and assuring yourself you are allowed to copy this repo...*

  * **Before running...**
    > ... fill up an ``.env`` file with the following variables
  ```.env
    MS_DB_CLUST_USR= 
    CMS_DB_CLUST_PASS=
    CMS_DB_CLUST_URI=
   
    #Msgs db related
    CMS_MSG_DB_NAME=
   
    #Auth0 tennat config
    TENNANT_ENDPOINT=
    CURR_AUDIENCE=
  ```

  * **...Development**
  ```bash
   # With cargo-make and fleet installed
   cd ./tumex-svc-backcms-gqlfst-1
   cargo make dev
   
   # Without cargo-watch and fleet
   CARGO_TARGET_DIR=./target/dev cargo run --profile dev --out-dir ./target/dev 
   
   # Note that specifying the the cargo target dir is totally optional. 
   # It just helps prevent rust_analyser server, from conflicting with the build target
   # hence causing both to take more time to compile/analyze the codebase
  ```

  * **...Production**
  ```bash
   # With cargo make
   cd ./tumex-svc-backcms-gqlfst-1
   cargo make start 
   # No need to run the build taks as start task takes it as requirement, thefore build is executed automatically before running 
   
   # Without cargo make
   CARGO_TARGET_DIR=./build cargo build --release -Z unstable-options --out-dir ./build
   ## Then
   ./build/rust-mailer-api

   # Again: specifying out dir is totally optional! (if you remove it, make sure you also remove "-Z unstable-options", which is required when specifying builds out dir)
  ```

  * Access:
  **Voil√†, you should have access to the server via [``` localhost:8000 ```](http://localhost:8000)**
